### **Q: How can I add an extra user to my Families Plan?**

**A:** Bitwarden Family plans are currently capped at 6 users.

### **Q: How do I add or remove a user seat from my organization?**

**A:** You can add or remove user seats at any time and the cost will be automatically pro-rated and debited/credited based on usage. In order to change your user seats, you will want to log into the Web Vault (<https://vault.bitwarden.com>) and go to Settings>Organizations>{Your Org Name}>Settings sub-tab (Gears Icon)>Subscription.

### **Q: Can I pay with Bitcoin?**

**A:** Yes, please follow these steps:

1. If you haven’t already, create a free user account.
2. Once you do this, or if you already have a user account, navigate to Settings > Organizations > New Organization.
3. Create a free organization on <https://vault.bitwarden.com>.
4. Once that organization account is created, navigate to the admin area. Click on Settings (gear icon). Make sure it is the Settings under the Organization and not the Settings at the top.
5. Click on Billing, you can add Bitcoin credit to the account.
6. Once you have added the credit for the subscription amount, let us know, and we will generate and send you an invoice and activate the new account.
7. You will also receive an invoice from our payment processor (BitPay) at the time the Bitcoin is sent. After that, the Organization will be ready for use, you can also download a license file for your self-hosted installation, if you want to use that option.

### **Q: How do I get started with my organization?**

Once you have configured a payment method, let us know and we will finalize the subscription activation for you.

Q: How do I enable self-hosting for my account?
A: You’ll need to create an account in the Bitwarden cloud (<https://vault.bitwarden.com>) for billing purposes, and generating/downloading your license.
