1. bitwarden is 100% open source software. All of our source code is hosted on [GitHub][github] and is free for anyone
to review. Hundreds of software developers follow bitwarden's source code projects (and you can too!).
2. We do not store your passwords. We store encrypted versions of your passwords [that only you can unlock][encrypted].
Your sensitive information is all encrypted locally on your personal device before ever being sent to our cloud servers.
3. bitwarden has a reputation. bitwarden is used by thousands of people. If we did anything questionable or risky we
would be out of business.
