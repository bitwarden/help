bitwarden takes extreme measures to ensure that its websites, application, and cloud servers are secure. Part of this security
comes from the fact that [we rely on managed services and do not manage our cloud server infrastructure at all][cloud].

However, if for some reason bitwarden were to get hacked and your data was exposed, your information is still protected. This is
because bitwarden uses strong encryption and one-way salted hashing. As long as you use a strong master password, your data is
safe no matter who gets hold of it.
