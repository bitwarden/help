Bitwarden can autofill more than just your usernames and passwords! It can make online purchases and account creations a breeze. If you're unfamiliar with what these item types are, refer to our [Managing Items][managing-items-doc] article.

{% note %}The Bitwarden web browser extension is currently the only client capable of auto-filling these types of items.{% endnote %}

## Autofill an Identity

1. From a page that you wish to autofill, open the browser extension and find your Identity under the **Identities** section. {% image features/auto-fill-card-id/id_fill1.png %}
2. Click on the Identity. The Bitwarden browser extension will find any relevant fields that match the data in your identity and fill them. {% image features/auto-fill-card-id/id_fill2.png %}

## Autofill a Card

1. From a page that you wish to autofill, open the browser extension and find your Card under the **Cards** section. {% image features/auto-fill-card-id/card_fill1.png %}
2. Click on the Card. The Bitwarden browser extension will find any relevant fields that match the data in your card and fill them. {% image features/auto-fill-card-id/card_fill2.png %}

## Hide Identities and Cards

If you prefer that the Identities and Cards not be shown when opening the extension they can be hidden from view of the **Tab** section of the browser extension.

2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Other** section.
4. Select **Options**.
5. Select **Don't Show Cards on Tab Page**.
6. Select **Don't Show Identities on Tab Page**.
